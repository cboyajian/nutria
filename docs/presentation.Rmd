# Step 1: Save data, create repository, repository structure [Clarissa]


---

# Step 2: Load libraries

We knew we'd need the standard libraries we've been working with for data wrangling and plotting. We started with tidyverse, here, and janitor.
```{r, results=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

Later on in the data wrangling process, we realized we would need a few additional packages. `lubridate` facilitated the use of date data, and we used `patchwork` to compile faceted graphs.
```{r, results=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(patchwork)
```
