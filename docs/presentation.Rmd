```

## Goal


## Step 1: Save data, create repository (Project Set-up & Team Organization)


## Step 2: Load libraries

We knew we'd need the standard libraries we've been working with for data wrangling and plotting. We started with tidyverse, here, and janitor.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

Later on in the data wrangling process, we realized we would need a few additional packages. `lubridate` facilitated the use of date data, and we used `patchwork` to compile faceted graphs.
```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(patchwork)
```

## Step 3: Read & Munging Data


## Step 4: Creating Initial Plots


## Step 5: Beautify-ing Plots


## Results


## Challenge
